The Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201cSeven jogged my elbow.\u201d"
